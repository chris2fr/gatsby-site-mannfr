# MANN.fr

This is a new Gatsby website for Mann.fr.

## Alpha

This is a working Alpha-quality website. It isn't fully polished, but the basic structure and idea is here. I should be 80% functional.

The goals here were to :

1. Set up a basic website
2. Import content
3. Set up a home page
4. Set up three languages
5. Set up a contact form
6. Set up a search mechanism

The website was built from the ground up. There are a couple of content assumptions. Tags are in the ./content/tags directory. Posts are in the content directory. You may notice that the tags are also pages. Tags have a special frontmatter attribute `type:tag`. The content comes from Ghost with my [ghost-to-md](https://github.com/chris2fr/ghost-to-md).

## Backlog

This is an ordered list of work items for the next releases.

To do:

27. Editing and proofreading
40. Better manage site content
50. Have different search indexes and content per language
60. Rework the presentation of the search results 
70. Consider HTML boilerplate
80. Better the cover-image handling for pages without an image
90. Better the cover-image handling for posts, tags and pages
100. Activate SEO, especially for site header 
110. Integrate a CV application
120. Automate translation extraction https://github.com/i18next/i18next-parsergats
130. Put relationships between post, pages, tags and authors
140. Consider Netlify CMS
150. Authors from Ghost
160. Automatic translation from loclz or similar
170. Document this experience
180. Transpose password-protected content
190. Other content types from Ghost
200. Integrate specific data types for posts, pages, tags and authors 
210. Maybe introduce a notion of categories

#### Internationalization

#### Replacements in Markdown Links

My own content is in a git repository specific to me but not really backed up anywhere and that is scary. It is in ssh://chris2fr@contabo.mann.fr/home/chris2fr/git/mannfr-content.git and on my local machine under content. With the .gitignore on the main repository, I was able to put it there nicely.
